## Part 1: Basic Join Challenges

The following challenges require no more then 2-3 tables and use the same column 
names across all tables. Use basic `dplyr` verbs to answer specific questions.

<br>

**(1) Question:** Which 10 occupation titles (`OccupationData$Title`) have the 
highest number of "hot technologies" (`TechnologySkills$HotTechnology`)?

```{r}

# Code

```

<br>

**(2) Question:** Which 10 occupation titles (`OccupationData$Title`), with more 
than 15 unique technologies, have the highest proportion (%) of "hot technologies" 
(`TechnologySkills$HotTechnology`)?

```{r cache = TRUE}

# Code

```

<br>

**(3) Question:** Which unique occupation titles (`OccupationData$Title`) have 
"R" listed as a technology example (`TechnologySkills$Example`)? 

```{r cache = TRUE}

# Code

```

<br>

**(4) Question:** Which alternate occupation titles (`AlternateTitles`) have "R" 
listed as a technology example (`TechnologySkills$Example`)? 

```{r cache = TRUE}

# Code

```

<br>

**(5) Question:** Which top 25 occupation titles (`OccupationData$Title`) have 
the highest level of "Independence" (`Element Name`) according to `WorkValues`?

```{r}

# Code

```

<br>

**(6) Question:** Which top 25 occupation titles (`OccupationData$Title`) have 
the highest level of "Persistence" (`Element Name`) according to `WorkStyles`?

```{r}

# Code

```

<br>

**(7) Question:** According to Holland Codes, "Realistic" describes people who 
like to work with things, requiring "motor coordination, skill, and strength".
Which top 20 occupation titles (`OccupationData$Title`) have the highest rating 
in "Realistic" scores (`Element Name`) according to `Interests`?

```{r cache = T}

# Code

```

<br>

**(8) Question:** Again, per Holland Codes, "Investigative" describes people who 
like to work with ideas, preferring observation over action and facts over 
feelings. Which top 20 occupation titles (`OccupationData$Title`) have the 
highest rating in "Investigative" scores (`Element Name`) according to `Interests`?

```{r cache = T}

# Code

```

<br>

**(9) Question:** Job Zones loosely classify how advanced one typically must be 
as an occupational incumbent. How many unique occupation titles 
(`OccupationData$Title`) are classified in each `Job Zone` (`JobZones`)? 

```{r}

# Code

```

<br>

**(10) Question:** Of occupation titles (`OccupationData$Title`) that list "R" 
as the `Example` in `TechnologySkills`, what proportion is in each Job Zone 
(`JobZones`)?

```{r}

# Code

```

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Part 2: Joins & Salary Predictions

The following challenges require 3-4 merged tables and incorporate data from the 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2021
[Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm)
which, like other federal agencies, uses unique SOC codes for each occupation.

<br>

The following commands will read in BLS data and rename and reformat the columns 
to match O*NET.

```{r cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DS4PS/ays-r-cod",
              "ing-sum-2022/main/labs/bls_occupation_salaries.csv")

Salaries <- read_csv(url, 
                     col_select = c("O*NET-SOC Code" = "OCC_CODE", 
                                    "Title" = "OCC_TITLE", 
                                    "Median" = "A_MEDIAN")) %>% 
  mutate(`O*NET-SOC Code` = gsub(x = `O*NET-SOC Code`, 
                                 pattern = "$", 
                                 replacement = "\\.00"),
         Median = gsub(x = Median, 
                       pattern = ",", 
                       replacement = ""),
         Median = as.numeric(Median))

```

<br>

**Note:** There is one key distinction between O*NET and BLS SOC codes. The 
[2019 O*NET Taxonomy](https://www.onetcenter.org/taxonomy.html) features even 
more detailed profiles than typical federal agencies. Some more detailed O*NET 
occupation profiles will not successfully merge with BLS occupations.

<br>

**(1) Question:** Join the O*NET `OccupationData` and BLS `Salaries` tables. 
Then, filter out any occupations with an `NA` value in variable `Median`.
Store this new table as object `Common`. How many occupations have
salary data available from BLS?


```{r cache = TRUE}

# Code
  
```

Use basic `dplyr` verbs to answer each question.

<br>

**(2) Question:** Join new object `Common` with object `Interests`. Note that 
each interest is in `Element Name` and each interest rating (on a 7-point scale) 
is listed in `Data Value`. In effect, we can now associate each "interest" (e.g. 
artistic, social, enterprising) with median annual salaries.

Use the `lm()` function with formula `Median ~ Element Name` to print the 
coefficients of a simple linear model. Which two element names (not "High 
Points") are most associated with higher salaries?

```{r cache = TRUE}

# Code

```

<br>

**(3) Question:** Now join `Common` with `TechnologySkills`. Filter occupations 
to only include the following technologies in `Example`, which have been 
provided for you in object `tech`: 

* R
* C
* Python
* JavaScript
* Microsoft Excel
* Spreadsheet software
* SAS statistical software
* Hypertext markup language HTML

Group by technologies (`Example`) and determine the following summaries:

* Average value for `Median` (annual salary)
* Count for total occupations with said `tech` 

```{r cache = TRUE}

tech <- c("R",
          "C++",
          "Python",
          "JavaScript",
          "Microsoft Excel",
          "Spreadsheet software",
          "SAS statistical software",
          "Hypertext markup language HTML")

# Code

```

<br>

**(4) Question:** Please rate your own work values by providing a score from 
`1` to `7` for the following value categories.

* Achievement
* Working Conditions
* Recognition
* Relationships
* Support
* Independence 

A "7" indicates highest importance. A "1" indicates lowest importance. 
A default of `3.5` has been provided as an example.

```{r echo = TRUE}

my_values <- tibble::tibble("Achievement"        = 3.5, 
                            "Working Conditions" = 3.5,
                            "Recognition"        = 3.5,
                            "Relationships"      = 3.5,
                            "Support"            = 3.5,
                            "Independence"       = 3.5)

```

<br>

**(5) Question:** Join objects `Common` and `WorkValues` and filter the 
following values from variable `Element Name`:

* "First Work Value High-Point"
* "Second Work Value High-Point"
* "Third Work Value High-Point"

Then, use `select()` on the following variables:

* "O*NET-SOC Code"
* "Element Name" 
* "Data Value" 
* "Median"

Pipe (`%>%`) your output into the following `tidyr` function:

```{r eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}

# Code

tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "Element Name", 
                   values_from = "Data Value")

```

<br>

Lastly, use function `lm()` and `predict()` to estimate your salary based on 
your work values! 

Make sure to set `eval = TRUE` for the following to run:

```{r eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}

my_model <- lm(formula = Median ~ 
                 Achievement + 
                 `Working Conditions` + 
                 Recognition + 
                 Relationships + 
                 Support + 
                 Independence, 
               data = you_data)

predict(object = my_model, newdata = my_values)

```

## How to Submit

Use the following instructions to submit your assignment, which may vary depending on your course's platform.

<br>

### Knitting to HTML

When you have completed your assignment, click the "Knit" button to render your `.RMD` file into a `.HTML` report.

<br>

### Special Instructions

Perform the following depending on your course's platform:

* **Blackboard or iCollege:** Compress your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files in a `.ZIP` file and upload to the appropriate link

<br>

### Before You Submit

Remember to ensure the following before submitting your assignment.

1. Name your files using this format: **Lab-##-LastName.rmd** and **Lab-##-LastName.html**
2. Show both the solution for your code and write out your answers in the body text 
3. Do not show excessive output; truncate your output, e.g. with function `head()`
4. Follow appropriate styling conventions, e.g. spaces after commas, etc.
5. Above all, ensure that your conventions are consistent

See [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) for examples of common conventions.

<br>
<br>

### Common Knitting Issues

`.RMD` files are knit into `.HTML` and other formats procedural, or line-by-line.

* An error in code when knitting will halt the process; error messages will tell you the specific line with the error
* Certain functions like `install.packages()` or `setwd()` are bound to cause errors in knitting 
* Altering a dataset or variable in one chunk will affect their use in all later chunks
* If an object is "not found", make sure it was created or loaded with `library()` in a previous chunk

**If All Else Fails:** If you cannot determine and fix the errors in a code chunk that's preventing you from knitting your document, add `eval = FALSE` inside the brackets of `{r}` at the beginning of a chunk to ensure that R does not attempt to evaluate it, that is: `{r eval = FALSE}`. This will prevent an erroneous chunk of code from halting the knitting process.
