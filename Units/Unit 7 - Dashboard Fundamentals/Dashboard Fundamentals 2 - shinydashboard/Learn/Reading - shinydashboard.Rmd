# What Is shinydashboard?

Package `shinydashboard` is a powerful, popular framework for constructing 
Shiny applications in R. The structure of `shinydashboard` apps is intuitive
and similar to base Shiny applications, albeit with more stylistic elements,
such as collapsible sidebar menu and an even fancier version of existing 
shiny input and output functions, easily and conveniently adding a pleasant 
aesthetic to anything you build

In fact, with a bit of familiarity, you'll be able to begin recognizing the 
sleek design of `shinydashboard` whenever you encounter it, as despite their
wonderful cosmetic upgrades over base Shiny apps, they tend to use the same 
structure we outline below.
